        <div class="subheading mb-5">Cultural AnthropologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Veronica Sanchez Gomez is currently a fourth year anthropology student at the University of California, Riverside. They are an exceptionally dedicated student, artist, and employee. Having worked for Chicano Student Programs at UCR for the past four years they are knowledgeable about various resources on campus that may aid incoming students and transfers. Veronica is an important aid for students and continuously mentors and offers knowledge as she is a first generation, queer, and low-income student. Along with Chicano Student Programs, Veronica has also worked with Undocumented Student Programs, the department of Hispanic Studies, specifically the SOCAL (Spanish of California) Lab, among others. Veronica focuses on marketing strategies and content creation in their place of work.They have designed more than 12 illustrations in collaboration with latinx, queer, and undocumented communities at her university.<br><br>

        One of the most successful designs includes that of 2023â€™s spring quarter Semana de la Mujer designs. The design included the likeness of her grandmother to embody the student chosen theme for that year. Theme; HERSTORY is healing, strength, and the act of resistance. As we unlearn the things that no longer service us, lagrimas are what helps us release and nourish. Seguiremos floreciendo y brotando con alegrÃ­a. This art piece was physically embodied through a traditional acrylic canvas piece measuring about two by three feet in stature, as well as a digital design that was then rasterized and duplicated onto an assortment of t-shirts, flyers, centerpieces, posters among other marketing materials. This large painting was also exhibited in the Tomas Rivera Library during womenâ€™s month in what was known as the first annual Archive and Collective Memory project. Veronica also is a second year fellow with the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship at the University of California, Riverside. She conducts research on Undocumented and queer artists and their contribution to the social movement known as UndocuQueer. Veronica has presented her research in various conferences including the Mellon Mays Regional Conference at Long Beach in 2023. Veronica hopes to continue creating art as an artist scholar and serve the people in her respective communities.<br><br>

        Veronica comes from a rural rancho in Guanajuato Mexico. She came to the United States at the age of five. Experiencing her early formative years in Mexico fostered their cultural identity as a Guanajuatense. These cultural practices and spaces shaped her love for Anthropology as she began my education in the United States. Coming from a rural background, they have developed a passion for community building and storytelling. In the pursuit of these passions Veronica aims to go for a Doctorate degree after receiving her Bachelors of Arts in Anthropology with a concentration in Cultural Anthropology. They plan to continue conducting research in marginalized and underrepresented communities and continue being a proud advocate for education. Veronica has the career aspiration of curating exhibitions in latinx, Mexican, or indigenous based museums as she has an extensive list of courses that have aided her in the knowledge of certain artifacts, art works, and cultural histories.
